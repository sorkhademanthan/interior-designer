# Navbar Fixes - Complete

## Date: 2024

---

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **React Router Integration**
**Problem**: Navbar was using `<a href>` tags for internal routes, causing full page reloads.

**Solution**: 
- ✅ Imported `Link` and `useNavigate` from react-router-dom
- ✅ Replaced `<a href="/features">` with `<Link to="/features">`
- ✅ Replaced `<a href="/pricing">` with `<Link to="/pricing">`
- ✅ Made logo clickable with `<Link to="/">`

### 2. **Missing Navbar on New Pages**
**Problem**: Navbar wasn't appearing on Features and Pricing pages.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added Navbar component to FeaturesPage
- ✅ Added Navbar component to PricingPage
- ✅ Added scroll state management for sticky navbar effect

### 3. **Button Functionality**
**Problem**: Gallery and Book consultation buttons did nothing.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Gallery button now navigates to `/#portfolio`
- ✅ Book consultation button navigates to `/#contact`
- ✅ Both mobile and desktop buttons work properly

### 4. **CSS Styling**
**Problem**: Link elements had underlines and wrong colors.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Added CSS to remove text-decoration from all navbar links
- ✅ Ensured proper color inheritance
- ✅ Maintained hover effects

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:

#### 1. `src/components/Navbar.jsx`
```javascript
// Added imports
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

// Logo now a Link
<Link to="/" className="navbar__logo">Aurora</Link>

// Internal routes use Link
<Link to="/features">Services</Link>
<Link to="/pricing">Pricing</Link>

// Buttons have onClick handlers
<button onClick={() => navigate('/#portfolio')}>Gallery</button>
<button onClick={() => navigate('/#contact')}>Book consultation</button>
```

#### 2. `src/pages/FeaturesPage.jsx`
```javascript
// Added Navbar import and scroll state
import Navbar from '../components/Navbar';
const [isScrolled, setIsScrolled] = useState(false);

// Added scroll listener
useEffect(() => {
  window.scrollTo(0, 0);
  const handleScroll = () => setIsScrolled(window.scrollY > 28);
  window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll, { passive: true });
  return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
}, []);

// Wrapped page with Navbar
return (
  <>
    <Navbar isScrolled={isScrolled} />
    <div className="features-page">
      {/* page content */}
    </div>
  </>
);
```

#### 3. `src/pages/PricingPage.jsx`
```javascript
// Same changes as FeaturesPage
// Added Navbar with scroll state management
```

#### 4. `src/App.css`
```css
/* Added link styling fixes */
.navbar__logo {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: inherit;
}

.navbar__links a,
.navbar__links a:visited {
  text-decoration: none;
  color: inherit;
