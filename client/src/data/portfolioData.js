    description: 'Perched 62 floors above Manhattan, Nocturne Overlook reimagines urban luxury through the lens of quietude. Every surface whispers—from the charred oak wall panels to the hand-forged brass fireplace suspended above Italian marble. The space unfolds as a series of intimate vignettes, each calibrated for contemplation.',
    
    challenge: 'The clients sought an escape from the frenetic energy below while maintaining the drama inherent to their panoramic views. Traditional penthouse opulence felt hollow; they craved something more introspective, a space that could absorb light during the day and glow softly through the night.',
    
    solution: 'We orchestrated a material palette of shadow and shimmer: fumed oak millwork, oxidized brass details, and custom smoked-mirror installations that fragment and soften the cityscape. Lighting was programmed to shift imperceptibly throughout the day, mimicking natural rhythms. The floating hearth became both sculpture and sanctuary, defining the main living space without walls.',

    description: 'Hamilton Muse honors the soul of a 1820s Georgian townhouse while weaving in the accumulated treasures of its new custodians—a couple whose diplomatic careers spanned four continents. The project became an exercise in layering: classical bones, contemporary restraint, and deeply personal artifacts.',
    
    challenge: 'The structure needed comprehensive restoration, but the clients rejected a museum-like formality. They wanted warmth, narrative, and spaces that could host both intimate dinners and official receptions. Balancing preservation with livability required surgical precision.',
    
    solution: 'We stripped back to the original plaster and oak floors, then rebuilt with intention. New architectural elements—arched doorways, custom moldings—echo the Georgian vocabulary but feel effortlessly modern. Bronze inlays in floor thresholds map the couple\'s travel routes. Textiles sourced from Istanbul, Marrakech, and Kyoto add layers of texture without overwhelming the refined envelope.',

    description: 'Carved into the cliffs above Positano, Serenade Pavilion reimagines the boutique hotel as an immersive sanctuary. Eight suites cascade down the hillside, each with private terraces overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea. The design language borrows from Mediterranean vernacular while introducing Japanese restraint—a hybrid that feels both timeless and unexpected.',
    
    challenge: 'The site presented extreme constraints: steep terrain, strict preservation codes, and the need to create privacy despite close proximity to neighboring villas. The clients wanted luxury without ostentation, spaces that would photograph beautifully but feel intimate in person.',
    
    solution: 'We designed a series of pavilions connected by fragrant gardens and stone pathways. Floor-to-ceiling sliding glass panels dissolve boundaries between interior and terrace. Silk lacquer walls in muted earth tones catch the shifting light, while local limestone and reclaimed terracotta ground the spaces. A central courtyard with a shallow reflecting pool became the heart of the property, visible from every suite.',
